Basic Information:
A file is sent from Sender application to the Receiver application reliably over UDP. The nem application can be used to emulate packet drops.

how to run:
./nEmulator <parameters>
java Sender <parameters>
java Receiver <parameters>


machines tested on:
network emulator ubuntu1204-002
Receiver ubuntu1204-006
Sender ubuntu1204-004

Additional Information:
There is a convenient bash script file called net.sh.
The script assumes the script will be executed on the right
machine based on the information under "machines tested on"

You could modify the script file to change that up. A more simple
approach is to make everything localhost

"./net.sh nem" starts the emulator
"./net.sh send" starts the Sender
"./net.sh recv" starts the Receiver
